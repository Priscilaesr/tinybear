            <p>
                From infant to toddler, preschool to school age, my goal is to provide the children with the skills necessary to succeed at both school and life, most of them gained by a strong sense of play. <br> <br>

                Each day time is shared among learning and playing activities. The children will be involved in both hands-on and group activities at the daycare. <br> <br>
                Even if each day has its unique program, it follows a general schedule presented below: <br> <br>
                7:30 - 8:30	ARRIVAL/INDOOR FREE ACTIVITIES <br>                                                                      
                8:30 - 9:00	WASHROOM ROUTINE <br>
                9:00 - 9:30	SNACK <br>
                9:30 - 10:00	CIRCLE TIME <br>
                10:00 - 10:30	CLEAN UP / GET DRESSED <br>
                10:30 - 11:30	OUTDOOR SELF DIRECTED ACTIVITIES <br>
                11:30 - 12:00	WASHROOM ROUTINE <br>
                12:00 - 1:00	LUNCH TIME <br>
                1:00 - 3:00	SLEEPING TIME <br>
                3:00 - 3:30	WASHROOM ROUTINE <br>
                3:30 - 3:45	SNACK <br>
                3:45 - 4:00	CLEAN UP / GET DRESSED <br>
                4:00 - 5:00	OUTDOOR SELF DIRECTED / DEPARTURE <br> <br>
                Schedule is subject to adjustments as required to meet childrenâ€™s needs. Like most family homes, ours has a flexible routine that can change from day to day.
