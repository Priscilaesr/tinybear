                Each child who comes to <strong>Tiny Bear</strong> family has an <strong>unique</strong> personality. Their interests, inclination, feelings and perceptions grow and change on a daily basis. This is part of being an <strong>unique</strong> individual in a crucial pathway of growing up. We respect that, and we do our very best to foster and encourage this <strong>individuality</strong> within every child.
                <br>
                <br>
                On our routine, we see these changes and create learning moments with each child that are based on these naturally occurring curiosities. We strive to remain <strong>flexible</strong>, and to continue to <strong>encourage</strong> a style of learning that is not forced, regimented or disciplined but is open, <strong>creative, supportive and natural.</strong>

                Working with children is a great <strong>pleasure</strong> for me, specially when I see the results. They are very smart and learn very fast making me <strong>proud</strong> to see it. I was fortunate enough to work with children since I arrived in Toronto as a babysiter. In the meantime, my <strong>passion</strong> for working with children became stronger, until I decided to make it into a career.

                <br>
                I have always <strong>enjoyed</strong> being with children, planning various activities to help them learn and grow. I like children to be as <strong>independent</strong> as possible but yet I still enjoy helping them out whenever they need help.

                I am certified in <strong>CPR</strong> and in <strong>First Aid</strong>, and I have been working with children for many years. My love for children, patience and understanding their special needs will help me to become their <strong>best friend.</strong>
