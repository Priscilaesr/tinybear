            About Tiny Bear  
        </h1>

        <p>
            We are more than just a private home daycare; it is a nurturing environment designed to meet the needs of your entire family. Our goal is to create a happy place for your little ones to play, discover, and learn while growing up. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Every color, every corner, every detail of our bear den was carefully crafted with your child's best interests in mind. So tiny, your baby is not yet ready to leave the nest, so our aim is to extend the comfort and security of your home to our daycare, so your child can feel safe, loved, and cared for at all times. 
        </p>

        <p>
            At Tiny Bear, we recognize the importance of play-based learning and exploration, especially when it comes to incorporating elements of nature. We believe that play is a crucial part of the learning process, helping to facilitate creativity, autonomy, and overall growth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each child who becomes a part of the Tiny Bear family is unique, with their own individual personality, interests, and feelings. We understand that these traits are constantly evolving and changing, and we strive to create learning moments that reflect each child's natural curiosities and inclinations. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Our approach to learning is flexible, supportive, and natural. We believe that true learning occurs when a child is not forced or disciplined, but rather encouraged in an open and creative environment. Our aim is to foster and encourage the individuality of every child who walks through our doors.

            Working with children is a great <strong>pleasure</strong> for me, specially when I see the results. They are very smart and learn very fast making me <strong>proud</strong> to see it. I was fortunate enough to work with children since I arrived in Toronto as a babysiter. In the meantime, my <strong>passion</strong> for working with children became stronger, until I decided to make it into a career. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have always <strong>enjoyed</strong> being with children, planning various activities to help them learn and grow. I like children to be as <strong>independent</strong> as possible but yet I still enjoy helping them out whenever they need help.

            I am certified in <strong>CPR</strong> and in <strong>First Aid</strong>, and I have been working with children for many years. My love for children, patience and understanding their special needs will help me to become their <strong>best friend.</strong>
