            About Tiny Bear  
        </h1>

        <p>
            We are more than just a private home daycare; it is a nurturing environment designed to meet the needs of your entire family. Our goal is to create a happy place for your little ones to play, discover, and learn while growing up. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Every color, every corner, every detail of our bear den was carefully crafted with your child's best interests in mind. So tiny, your baby is not yet ready to leave the nest, so our aim is to extend the comfort and security of your home to our daycare, so your child can feel safe, loved, and cared for at all times. 
        </p>

        <p>
            At Tiny Bear, we recognize the importance of play-based learning and exploration, especially when it comes to incorporating elements of nature. We believe that play is a crucial part of the learning process, helping to facilitate creativity, autonomy, and overall growth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each child who becomes a part of the Tiny Bear family is unique, with their own individual personality, interests, and feelings. We understand that these traits are constantly evolving and changing, and we strive to create learning moments that reflect each child's natural curiosities and inclinations. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Our approach to learning is flexible, supportive, and natural. We believe that true learning occurs when a child is not forced or disciplined, but rather encouraged in an open and creative environment. Our aim is to foster and encourage the individuality of every child who walks through our doors.
        </p>

            <p>
                Working with children is a great pleasure for me, specially when I notice their rapid progress and growth. I was fortunate enough to begin my career in Toronto as a babysitter, during my studying time at college, where my passion for working with children grew stronger each day. Eventually, after a brainstorm with my family, I decided to turn my passion into a full-time career. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have always enjoyed planning various activities to help children learn and develop, while encouraging their independence. However, I also love being there to support and assist them whenever they need it.   
            </p>

            <p>
                I am certified in CPR and in First Aid, and I have been working with children for many years. My love for children, patience and understanding their special needs will help me to provide a safe, nurturing, and fun environment for your child and also, become their best friend.I believe in building strong relationships with each child and their family.
            </p>
        
        <p>
